description: Tactical view of "what do I work on now?" — remaining items ranked by readiness (🔥 hot · 🏗️ in progress · ✅ ready · ⏳ on trigger · 💤 someday), tagged fix/feature + ADR.
---

# What's left

Produce a **tactical view** of what's left to do: the answer to *"what do I work on now?"*, not an exhaustive inventory. Don't invent anything — aggregate from canonical sources and **re-render** without rewriting them.

> **Primary axis = readiness** ("can I act on this now?"), **not** the backlog's resting priority. The resting order (README section order) is raw material; you **re-express** it as *is this actionable*, and you **compress the long tail**.

## Canonical sources (read in this order)

1. **`docs/backlog/README.md`** — skeleton. Its sections are the **resting** prioritization; they feed the readiness classification (mapping below), they are **not** the output's section plan.
2. **`docs/plans/<slug>.md`** with frontmatter `status: in-progress` — extract:
   - unchecked `[ ]` items from `## Next actions`;
   - open topics from `## Open questions` not yet resolved (not `~~…~~`);
   - `Lot N — …` entries from `## Implementation lots` missing from `## Progress` / Decision log as shipped.
   - **Silent-delivery detection**: for a Lot/Phase with no "shipped" entry in `## Progress`/`## Decision log`, check the code side via a distinctive string grep. Code present + plan silent ⇒ flag in the summary as **silent delivery to acknowledge** — do NOT list as a TODO.

**Do NOT use**: `// TODO:` / `// FIXME:` / `// XXX:` in code (noisy, non-canonical); issue trackers unless referenced from the backlog/a plan.

**Exclude**: closing/archive README sections (e.g. "Reference (closed topics)").

## Output format

One single response. Header, then 5 sections **in this fixed order**, then a summary.

**Header** (1 line):
```
# What's left — <date> · <N> open items          🐛 fix · ✨ feature · 🛠️ tech · 🧭 doctrine
```

**Item line** (🔥 / ✅ sections):
```
- <type> **Short title** — why in 1 line · effort if known · [ADR 00XX] · `backlog/<file>.md`
```
- `<type>` = one of 4 emojis (🐛 fix · ✨ feature · 🛠️ tech/debt/tooling · 🧭 doctrine/decision), inferred from the item's nature.
- `[ADR 00XX]` only if the item references an ADR/plan. Otherwise omit the tag.

**Item line** (⏳ section, the trigger is the title):
```
- ⏳ **<trigger condition>** → <type> Item title · `backlog/<file>.md`
```

### The 5 sections

1. **🔥 Hot now** *(promoted by context — 0 to 4 items max)*. Items the **current session**, a **recent commit**, or an **imminent release** make relevant *right now*. Each **must** carry the context signal that promotes it. If none: write *"Nothing promoted by context — resting view."* and move on.
2. **🏗️ Work in progress** *(by ADR / plan)*. For each `status: in-progress` plan: under a `ADR 00XX — <topic>` heading, open `[ ]` from `## Next actions` + unshipped Lots (with their type tag). A plan with nothing open: `ADR 00XX — <topic>: nothing open`.
3. **✅ Ready to start** *(trigger satisfied or no prerequisite)*. **Selective**: high-priority + targeted actions + tech debt + bundles with nothing blocking the start. Sorted by type. **Not all N items** — only the ones actually actionable and worth proposing.
4. **⏳ On trigger** *(the trigger is the title)*. Items waiting on a signal: those with a documented Trigger field **not yet satisfied**, plus README sections like "waiting on a signal" or "doctrines to mature". Scan the conditions and **match against reality**; an item whose trigger looks close/met **moves up** to ✅ (say so in the summary).
5. **💤 Someday/maybe** *(compressed — never expanded in normal mode)*. Dormant items, holes without a trigger: **counted + pointer**, not listed. E.g. `12 dormant with no active trigger → backlog/README.md § Dormant`.

**Summary (3-5 lines)**: total open items · **natural next step** (the first item of 🔥, else 🏗️, else ✅) · context promotions/demotions with their why · *stale* signals (item checked off elsewhere but not in the README, or the reverse; silent delivery) to clean up.
