# Bootstrap Claude environment

You are generating a **Claude Code working environment** — documentation structure, ADR↔plan↔backlog machinery, persistence conventions, and companion skills — into a target project. This is **not** a code scaffold: you never generate application code, dependencies, or a build system. The target project can be any language/stack, including one that doesn't exist yet.

Target path argument: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Phase 0 — Resolve the target directory

- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, target = current working directory.
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is a relative path, reject it and ask for an absolute path (this command may run from a different cwd than the target).
- If the target directory doesn't exist, create it (`mkdir -p`).
- If `<target>/CLAUDE.md` already exists, stop and ask the user how to proceed: overwrite, merge (show a diff of what would change per-file), or abort. Never silently overwrite existing project docs.

## Phase 1 — Locate this kit's templates and pick a language

Resolve `KIT_ROOT` in this order, stop at the first hit:
1. `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_KIT_HOME` env var, if set and `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_KIT_HOME/templates` exists.
2. `./templates` relative to the current working directory (covers the case where you're running this from inside a `claude-project-kit` checkout).
3. `/mnt/c/dev/claude-project-kit/templates` (default known location on this machine).

If none exist, stop and ask the user for the path to their `claude-project-kit` checkout.

List `KIT_ROOT`'s immediate subdirectories — each one is a language variant (e.g. `en`, `fr`). Ask the user which one to use via `AskUserQuestion`, defaulting the suggested option to the language they're currently conversing in if it matches an available variant. Resolve `TPL_ROOT = KIT_ROOT/<chosen-lang>`. Every path referenced as `templates/...` in the phases below means `TPL_ROOT/...` (i.e. language-relative, not `KIT_ROOT` directly).

If only one language variant exists, skip the question and use it silently.

## Phase 2 — Analyze existing code (if any)

List the target directory (excluding `.git`). If it's empty or contains only a handful of non-code files (README, LICENSE), **skip this phase** — there's nothing to detect, move to Phase 3 with all fields blank.

Otherwise, analyze with the same ambition the native `/init` command would bring to generating a `CLAUDE.md` — this is a real pass, not a shallow manifest sniff:
- Glob for manifest/config files at the root and one level down: `package.json`, `*.csproj`/`*.sln`, `pyproject.toml`/`requirements.txt`/`Pipfile`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `Gemfile`, `composer.json`, `pom.xml`/`build.gradle*`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose*.yml`.
- Read any existing `README`/`CONTRIBUTING` for stated conventions — reuse what's already documented there rather than re-guessing it.
- Sample actual source files (not just manifests) across each detected top-level module to ground: language/framework, **code style actually in use** (indentation, quote/naming conventions, linter/formatter config files), test setup, and what each top-level directory is really for.
- Declared scripts and CI config (`package.json` → `scripts`, `Makefile`/`Taskfile` targets, `.github/workflows/` or similar) for build/test/run/lint commands.
- Grep for `TODO`/`FIXME`/`XXX` comments across source files. If there's a non-trivial number, count them and keep a few representative samples for Phase 3 — don't triage or import them yet.
- Scale the exploration to size: for anything beyond a handful of files, don't read the codebase yourself file-by-file — launch `Explore` agents **in parallel**, one per top-level module/directory, each asked for a structured report (module purpose, key files, conventions observed, build/test hooks).

Keep everything as draft answers for Phase 3 — present for confirmation, never commit silently. This is still a **best-effort starting point**, not a substitute for the user's own judgment on a genuinely large codebase — say so explicitly when that's the case. But the bar to aim for is "as close as reasonably achievable to what a dedicated `/init` pass would produce," not a deliberately watered-down version of it.

## Phase 3 — Framing questions

Ask the user (pre-filling defaults from Phase 2 where available):

- **Project name** — default: target directory's basename.
- **One-line description** — what the project does.
- **Primary stack** — pre-filled from Phase 2 if detected, otherwise ask.
- **Team** — solo or multiple contributors (affects whether `docs/prefs/` pulls its weight).
- **Backlog location** — this repo's `docs/backlog/` (Markdown, versioned) or an external tool already in use (Jira/Trello/Notion/Linear/GitHub Issues/other)? Don't assume: a team with an existing tracker will actively resent a competing one. If external: don't generate `docs/backlog/` at all, and in Phase 4 name that tool instead in `docs/persistence-strategy.md`'s "item to handle later" row and anywhere else `docs/backlog/` would otherwise be referenced (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/workflow.md` if Full profile) — a few-line manual touch-up per file, not a new placeholder mechanism.
- **Existing TODOs** *(only ask if Phase 2 found a non-trivial number)* — report the count and a few samples; ask whether to triage them into backlog items now (a one-time migration pass) or leave them as inline comments. Never import them automatically or silently — code `TODO`/`FIXME` comments are deliberately excluded as a backlog source elsewhere in this kit (see `whats-left.md`'s "do NOT use" list) precisely because they're noisy and untriaged; this question is a one-time opt-in assist, not an ongoing sync.
- **Profile** — **Full** (complete arsenal: ADR/plan/backlog/workflow/prefs/tooling-inventory/dashboard) or **Minimal** (just `CLAUDE.md`, `architecture.md`, `operations.md`, `lessons-technical.md`, `docs/backlog/README.md`, `docs/persistence-strategy.md`). Default recommendation: Full if team ≥ 2 or the user mentions wanting to track decisions long-term; Minimal for a prototype/POC. See `ADAPTING.md` in the kit for the full decision table — don't just ask blindly, give a recommendation with the why.
- **Memory-block hook** — **strongly recommend enabling it**, regardless of profile or team size. Private memory that never gets versioned is an easy way to silently lose decisions, drift from what the team actually agreed, or leak assumptions across projects with no audit trail — this gets worse, not better, over time, and is genuinely costly to discover after the fact. Say this plainly, don't present it as a neutral coin-flip. Still ask — don't force it — but the default answer you argue for is *yes*. If the user declines, that's their call, but make sure they've heard the reasoning first (see `docs/persistence-strategy.md.tpl`'s intro for the fuller argument).
- **Changelog module** *(Full profile only)* — does this project ship to users who'd care about a "what changed" note (a product, an app, a public library)? If so, offer the `docs/changelog/` module (`/changelog-capture` + `/changelog-draft`, see `docs/changelog/README.md.tpl`). Skip the question entirely for Minimal profile or for projects with no real "user" in this sense (an internal script, a one-off tool) — don't generate unused ceremony.

Use `AskUserQuestion` for these — they're genuine choices, not things to assume.

## Phase 4 — Generate

For every file under `TPL_ROOT` (the language variant chosen in Phase 1), apply this mapping to the target:
- `templates/CLAUDE.md.tpl` → `<target>/CLAUDE.md`
- `templates/docs/**/*.tpl` → `<target>/docs/**/*` (strip `.tpl`)
- `templates/docs/adr/template.md`, `templates/docs/plans/template.md` → copied verbatim (no placeholders, no `.tpl` suffix — already generic)
- `templates/dot-claude/**` → `<target>/.claude/**` (the kit stores it as `dot-claude` precisely so it isn't mistaken for the kit repo's *own* `.claude/` config)
- `templates/tools/generate-dashboard.py.tpl` → `<target>/tools/generate-dashboard.py`

**Placeholder substitution** — replace in every `.tpl` file:
- `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` → the confirmed project name
- `{{PROJECT_ONE_LINER}}` → the confirmed one-liner
- `{{PRIMARY_STACK}}` → the confirmed stack

**Profile-conditional blocks** — templates mark profile-specific content with `<!-- FULL-ONLY -->` ... `<!-- /FULL-ONLY -->`, `<!-- MINIMAL-ONLY -->` ... `<!-- /MINIMAL-ONLY -->`, and `<!-- CHANGELOG-ONLY -->` ... `<!-- /CHANGELOG-ONLY -->` markers (sometimes inline within a paragraph, sometimes wrapping whole sections/table rows — always on the same line as the row/text they gate, never a standalone marker line, to avoid leaving a blank line that breaks a Markdown table). When a block's condition holds (its profile is active / the changelog module was opted into): remove just the marker comments, keep the content. When it doesn't: remove the markers *and* everything between them, including the trailing newline, so nothing is left blank. `CHANGELOG-ONLY` is independent of the Full/Minimal choice — it's gated purely by the Phase 3 changelog question.

**Profile-driven file selection**:
- **Minimal**: generate only `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/operations.md`, `docs/lessons-technical.md`, `docs/backlog/README.md`, `docs/persistence-strategy.md`. Skip `docs/adr/`, `docs/plans/`, `docs/workflow.md`, `docs/prefs/`, `docs/claude-code-tooling.md`, `docs/lessons-domain.md`, `tools/generate-dashboard.py`, and the `.claude/commands/` skills (`new-adr`, `capture-lessons`, `whats-left`, `dashboard`).
- **Full**: generate everything except `docs/lessons-domain.md`, which you only generate if the project has a genuinely non-trivial business domain (ask if unsure — see `ADAPTING.md` § "Domaine métier riche ou pas ?"). Don't generate `docs/prefs/<login>.md` itself (only `docs/prefs/README.md` explaining the mechanism) — that's each contributor's own file to create.

**External backlog tool chosen in Phase 3**: don't generate `docs/backlog/` at all. In every generated file that references it (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/persistence-strategy.md`, `docs/workflow.md` if Full), replace the `docs/backlog/` reference with the named external tool instead — a direct text edit, not a new marker.

**Changelog module chosen in Phase 3**: generate `docs/changelog/README.md`, `docs/changelog/_next.md` (copied verbatim — no placeholders), `.claude/commands/changelog-capture.md`, `.claude/commands/changelog-draft.md`, and keep the `CHANGELOG-ONLY` cross-reference rows in `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/persistence-strategy.md`, `docs/claude-code-tooling.md`. If declined: skip those four files, and strip every `CHANGELOG-ONLY` block from the files above like any other unmet condition.

**Enrichment from Phase 2** — if code analysis ran, don't leave `TODO` placeholders where you have real answers:
- `CLAUDE.md`'s Project Overview, Stack, "Build & Development Commands", and **Code Style** sections → fill with what was actually observed in the code (real indentation/naming/linter config found), not generic language defaults.
- `docs/architecture.md`'s Overview + "Major components" (one real one-liner per detected top-level module, informed by the Explore reports — not a placeholder) + "Key flows" if a request lifecycle or entry point was identifiable.
- `docs/operations.md`'s Setup/Build/Run/Test sections → fill with detected commands where confidently identified; leave `TODO` for what you couldn't determine (e.g. deploy process, which is rarely inferable from the repo alone).
- If Phase 3's TODO-triage question was answered "yes", convert the samples found into backlog items (or into a note for the external tool, if that's where backlog lives) following the kit's usual granularity rules (`docs/workflow.md` § *Backlog item granularity*, Full profile) rather than dumping them in unfiltered.

If `<target>/.claude/settings.json` already exists (pre-existing project with its own Claude config), do **not** overwrite it — show the memory-block hook snippet from `templates/dot-claude/settings.json.tpl` and ask the user to merge it manually, or offer to merge it yourself with an explicit diff.

**Memory-block hook** — write `templates/dot-claude/settings.json.tpl` as-is if the user opted in during Phase 3; otherwise write `.claude/settings.json` without the `hooks` key (permissions block only), or skip the file entirely if there's nothing else to configure.

## Phase 5 — Git

- If `<target>` is not already a git repo, run `git init`.
- Stage everything generated this pass and commit: `docs: bootstrap Claude environment` (a separate `docs:` commit if the repo already has history).
- **Optional remote**: if `$FORGEJO_TOKEN` (or another git host token the user mentions) is present in the environment, offer to create a remote repository and push. Ask for **namespace** and **visibility** explicitly — do not default to any particular namespace/visibility for a project other than this kit's own origin. If no token is available, skip this sub-step and say so plainly in the summary rather than failing silently or improvising another auth method.

## Phase 6 — Summary

Show:
- The generated file tree.
- What was auto-detected in Phase 2 (so the user can spot-check/correct it) vs. what's still a blank `TODO`.
- Concrete next steps: flesh out `docs/architecture.md`, open a first ADR if there's already a pending decision, create `docs/prefs/<login>.md` (Full profile), regenerate the dashboard once there's at least one ADR (Full profile), run `/changelog-capture` after the next user-visible change (if the changelog module was included).

## What this skill does NOT do

- It does not install language dependencies, linters, or CI — this is a documentation/method scaffold, not an application scaffold.
- Phase 2's code analysis is best-effort discovery, not a substitute for the user actually writing `architecture.md` on a non-trivial codebase.
- It does not retro-propagate template improvements to already-bootstrapped projects — see `ADAPTING.md` § "Known limitation".
