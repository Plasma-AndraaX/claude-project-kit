# Bootstrap Claude environment

You are generating a **Claude Code working environment** — documentation structure, ADR↔plan↔backlog machinery, persistence conventions, and companion skills — into a target project. This is **not** a code scaffold: you never generate application code, dependencies, or a build system. The target project can be any language/stack, including one that doesn't exist yet.

Target path argument: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Phase 0 — Resolve the target directory

- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, target = current working directory.
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is a relative path, reject it and ask for an absolute path (this command may run from a different cwd than the target).
- If the target directory doesn't exist, create it (`mkdir -p`).
- If `<target>/CLAUDE.md` already exists, stop and ask the user how to proceed: overwrite, merge (show a diff of what would change per-file), or abort. Never silently overwrite existing project docs.

## Phase 1 — Locate this kit's templates and pick a language

Resolve `KIT_ROOT` in this order, stop at the first hit:
1. `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_KIT_HOME` env var, if set and `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_KIT_HOME/templates` exists.
2. `./templates` relative to the current working directory (covers the case where you're running this from inside a `claude-project-kit` checkout).
3. `/mnt/c/dev/claude-project-kit/templates` (default known location on this machine).

If none exist, stop and ask the user for the path to their `claude-project-kit` checkout.

List `KIT_ROOT`'s immediate subdirectories — each one is a language variant (e.g. `en`, `fr`). Ask the user which one to use via `AskUserQuestion`, defaulting the suggested option to the language they're currently conversing in if it matches an available variant. Resolve `TPL_ROOT = KIT_ROOT/<chosen-lang>`. Every path referenced as `templates/...` in the phases below means `TPL_ROOT/...` (i.e. language-relative, not `KIT_ROOT` directly).

If only one language variant exists, skip the question and use it silently.

## Phase 2 — Analyze existing code (if any)

List the target directory (excluding `.git`). If it's empty or contains only a handful of non-code files (README, LICENSE), **skip this phase** — there's nothing to detect, move to Phase 3 with all fields blank.

Otherwise, detect the stack:
- Glob for manifest/config files at the root and one level down: `package.json`, `*.csproj`/`*.sln`, `pyproject.toml`/`requirements.txt`/`Pipfile`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `Gemfile`, `composer.json`, `pom.xml`/`build.gradle*`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose*.yml`.
- From what you find, infer: primary language(s), framework(s), package manager, and — if present — declared scripts (`package.json` → `scripts`, `Makefile` targets, `Taskfile`, CI config under `.github/workflows/` or similar) that look like build/test/run commands.
- Note top-level directory structure (monorepo signals like `packages/`, `apps/`; a `src/` layout; a clear frontend/backend split).
- If the codebase is large (rough heuristic: more than ~50 files or more than 3-4 distinct top-level modules), don't read everything yourself — launch 1-2 `Explore` agents in parallel, each scoped to a specific area, and ask for a structured summary (detected stack, directory roles, build/test commands) rather than a file dump.

Keep what you find as draft answers for Phase 3 — you'll present them to the user for confirmation, not commit to them silently. This is a **best-effort starting point**, not an architecture audit — say so if the codebase is complex enough that `architecture.md` will need real follow-up work beyond this pass.

## Phase 3 — Framing questions

Ask the user (pre-filling defaults from Phase 2 where available):

- **Project name** — default: target directory's basename.
- **One-line description** — what the project does.
- **Primary stack** — pre-filled from Phase 2 if detected, otherwise ask.
- **Team** — solo or multiple contributors (affects whether `docs/prefs/` pulls its weight).
- **Profile** — **Full** (complete arsenal: ADR/plan/backlog/workflow/prefs/tooling-inventory/dashboard) or **Minimal** (just `CLAUDE.md`, `architecture.md`, `operations.md`, `lessons-technical.md`, `docs/backlog/README.md`, `docs/persistence-strategy.md`). Default recommendation: Full if team ≥ 2 or the user mentions wanting to track decisions long-term; Minimal for a prototype/POC. See `ADAPTING.md` in the kit for the full decision table — don't just ask blindly, give a recommendation with the why.
- **Memory-block hook** — **strongly recommend enabling it**, regardless of profile or team size. Private memory that never gets versioned is an easy way to silently lose decisions, drift from what the team actually agreed, or leak assumptions across projects with no audit trail — this gets worse, not better, over time, and is genuinely costly to discover after the fact. Say this plainly, don't present it as a neutral coin-flip. Still ask — don't force it — but the default answer you argue for is *yes*. If the user declines, that's their call, but make sure they've heard the reasoning first (see `docs/persistence-strategy.md.tpl`'s intro for the fuller argument).

Use `AskUserQuestion` for these — they're genuine choices, not things to assume.

## Phase 4 — Generate

For every file under `TPL_ROOT` (the language variant chosen in Phase 1), apply this mapping to the target:
- `templates/CLAUDE.md.tpl` → `<target>/CLAUDE.md`
- `templates/docs/**/*.tpl` → `<target>/docs/**/*` (strip `.tpl`)
- `templates/docs/adr/template.md`, `templates/docs/plans/template.md` → copied verbatim (no placeholders, no `.tpl` suffix — already generic)
- `templates/dot-claude/**` → `<target>/.claude/**` (the kit stores it as `dot-claude` precisely so it isn't mistaken for the kit repo's *own* `.claude/` config)
- `templates/tools/generate-dashboard.py.tpl` → `<target>/tools/generate-dashboard.py`

**Placeholder substitution** — replace in every `.tpl` file:
- `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` → the confirmed project name
- `{{PROJECT_ONE_LINER}}` → the confirmed one-liner
- `{{PRIMARY_STACK}}` → the confirmed stack

**Profile-conditional blocks** — templates mark profile-specific content with `<!-- FULL-ONLY -->` ... `<!-- /FULL-ONLY -->` and, more rarely, `<!-- MINIMAL-ONLY -->` ... `<!-- /MINIMAL-ONLY -->` markers (sometimes inline within a paragraph, sometimes wrapping whole sections/table rows). On the profile the block is *for*: remove just the marker comments, keep the content. On the other profile: remove the markers *and* everything between them. (A `MINIMAL-ONLY` block only exists where the Full wording would reference something — e.g. `docs/workflow.md` — that Minimal doesn't generate, and Minimal needs different, self-contained wording instead.)

**Profile-driven file selection**:
- **Minimal**: generate only `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/operations.md`, `docs/lessons-technical.md`, `docs/backlog/README.md`, `docs/persistence-strategy.md`. Skip `docs/adr/`, `docs/plans/`, `docs/workflow.md`, `docs/prefs/`, `docs/claude-code-tooling.md`, `docs/lessons-domain.md`, `tools/generate-dashboard.py`, and the `.claude/commands/` skills (`new-adr`, `capture-lessons`, `whats-left`, `dashboard`).
- **Full**: generate everything except `docs/lessons-domain.md`, which you only generate if the project has a genuinely non-trivial business domain (ask if unsure — see `ADAPTING.md` § "Domaine métier riche ou pas ?"). Don't generate `docs/prefs/<login>.md` itself (only `docs/prefs/README.md` explaining the mechanism) — that's each contributor's own file to create.

**Enrichment from Phase 2** — if code analysis ran, don't leave `TODO` placeholders where you have real answers:
- `CLAUDE.md`'s Stack line and "Build & Development Commands" section → fill with detected commands.
- `docs/architecture.md`'s Overview + a skeleton under "Major components" (one subsection per detected top-level module, left brief — the user fills in the substance).
- `docs/operations.md`'s Setup/Build/Run/Test sections → fill with detected commands where confidently identified; leave `TODO` for what you couldn't determine (e.g. deploy process, which is rarely inferable from the repo alone).

If `<target>/.claude/settings.json` already exists (pre-existing project with its own Claude config), do **not** overwrite it — show the memory-block hook snippet from `templates/dot-claude/settings.json.tpl` and ask the user to merge it manually, or offer to merge it yourself with an explicit diff.

**Memory-block hook** — write `templates/dot-claude/settings.json.tpl` as-is if the user opted in during Phase 3; otherwise write `.claude/settings.json` without the `hooks` key (permissions block only), or skip the file entirely if there's nothing else to configure.

## Phase 5 — Git

- If `<target>` is not already a git repo, run `git init`.
- Stage everything generated this pass and commit: `docs: bootstrap Claude environment` (a separate `docs:` commit if the repo already has history).
- **Optional remote**: if `$FORGEJO_TOKEN` (or another git host token the user mentions) is present in the environment, offer to create a remote repository and push. Ask for **namespace** and **visibility** explicitly — do not default to any particular namespace/visibility for a project other than this kit's own origin. If no token is available, skip this sub-step and say so plainly in the summary rather than failing silently or improvising another auth method.

## Phase 6 — Summary

Show:
- The generated file tree.
- What was auto-detected in Phase 2 (so the user can spot-check/correct it) vs. what's still a blank `TODO`.
- Concrete next steps: flesh out `docs/architecture.md`, open a first ADR if there's already a pending decision, create `docs/prefs/<login>.md` (Full profile), regenerate the dashboard once there's at least one ADR (Full profile).

## What this skill does NOT do

- It does not install language dependencies, linters, or CI — this is a documentation/method scaffold, not an application scaffold.
- Phase 2's code analysis is best-effort discovery, not a substitute for the user actually writing `architecture.md` on a non-trivial codebase.
- It does not retro-propagate template improvements to already-bootstrapped projects — see `ADAPTING.md` § "Known limitation".
